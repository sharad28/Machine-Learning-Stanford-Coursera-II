# Machine-Learning-Stanford-Coursera-II

This is my solution to 7 to 9  week the programming assignments of Machine-Learning (Coursera) taught by Andrew Ng. After completing this course you will get a broad idea of Machine learning algorithms. Try to solve all the assignments by yourself first, but if you get stuck somewhere then feel free to browse the code.
